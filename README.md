Final Project
Here is a readme to help you understand the following webpage.
first, start backwards from the beginning by taking three steps down,
look up and you'll notice a haning plant to your left.  Take your grappling
hook and lach onto the plant from a distance.

Once you have the plant hooked on to your grapple swing out over the ledge,
remember to not look down this is the scariest part.  Start to make your way down
look over your shoulder and if you see any griffins pull out your crossbow
and eliminate them.  Good, now keep on climbing down till you reach the bottom
of the cravace, take two stick rub them together until you make fire and then lay down
in it like phat-quan-duc, now you will have peace.
